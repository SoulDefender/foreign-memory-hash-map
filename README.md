This project is a library for HashMap storing data in foreign memory in Java.
Each HashMap instance must preallocate some memory on creation. The memory limit cannot be changed.
No automatic (behind the scene) Garbage collection is applied to the content of the HashMap.
USE THIS IN PRODUCTION ONLY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
